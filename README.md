# Small HTML Projects
Small projects i make in my free time. Feel free to use them for your own needs.

## Current Available Projects:
- TEK Generator Calculator (Doesnt work well, it was more a concept to learn basic HTML,CSS and JS)
- Tic Tac Toe game (Works completely, and counts Wins/Draws)

## Being Worked On:
- Weather App (Showing Weather in a city, using an API to get the Data)
